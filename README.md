# Prolog-sort-and-graphs
Three tasks written in Prolog:
1. Implementation of the predicate returning a sorted list in non-increasing order using the counting sort algorithm.
2. Implementation of the predicate that states whether the list creates a graphic sequence. It uses Havel-Hakimi algorithm in Largest-First version and sorting algorithm from the first task.
3. Implementation of the predicate stating whether the vertex degree list creates a graphic sequence from which the connected graph can be created. It uses Havel-Hakimi algorithm in Smallest-First version.
